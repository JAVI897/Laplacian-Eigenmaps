# Laplacian Eigenmaps

Laplacian Eigenmaps is another method for non-linear dimensionality reduction. It was proposed in 2003 by  Mikhail Belkin and Partha Niyogi. LE constructs embeddings based on the properties of the Laplacian matrix. At that time, Laplacian matrix was widely used for clustering problems (Spectral Clustering, for instance), but LE was the first algorithm that used the Laplacian matrix for dimensionality reduction. For a more detailed description on how the algorithm works see;
